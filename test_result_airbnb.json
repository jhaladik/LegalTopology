  "test_case": "Airbnb Unauthorized Sublease",
  "question": "Pronajímám byt v Praze za 25,000 Kč měsíčně. Po 6 měsících jsem zjistil, že nájemce byt bez mého souhlasu podnajímá turistům přes Airbnb za 3,000 Kč/noc (obsazenost cca 20 dní měsíčně = 60,000 Kč). Sousedi si stěžují na hluk, SVJ mi hrozí pokutou 50,000 Kč za porušení stanov. Nájemce tvrdí, že pouze 'příležitostně ubytovává kamarády' a že mu dávají jen 'příspěvek na náklady'. Mám kauci 50,000 Kč. Chci: buď okamžitě ukončit nájem, nebo ať mi nájemce platí vyšší nájem a podíl ze zisku z Airbnb.",

  "strengths": [
    "✅ Correctly decomposed complex question into 5 separate legal issues",

    "✅ Provided practical recommendations per issue",

    "✅ Proper prioritization of issues"

  "limitations": [
    "❌ CRITICAL: Missing §2991+ unjust enrichment analysis for tenant's profit",
    "❌ Profit sharing issue (#5) focused on partnership law (§730, §2752) not restitution",
    "❌ Analysis doesn't quantify tenant's unjust enrichment (40k Kč/month excess profit)",
    "❌ No case law found for noise complaints, SVJ penalties, or profit issues",
    "❌ Missing strategic synthesis - which option to prioritize: termination vs. renegotiation?",
    "❌ No cost-benefit analysis (50k deposit vs. 50k SVJ fine vs. ongoing profit loss)",
    "❌ Encoding issues in API response (Czech characters garbled)",
    "❌ Analysis doesn't address SVJ penalty liability and mitigation strategies",
    "❌ No discussion of burden of proof for Airbnb income",
    "❌ Missing procedural steps timeline"
